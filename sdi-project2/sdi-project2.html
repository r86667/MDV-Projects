<p>For assignment number 2 I'm going to tell a story about visiting the zoo. It reminds me of my child hood.</p>
<p>One morning we all decided to go to the zoo. We all wanted to see the elephants, tigers, monkeys, and the giraffes. We did get to see all of the animals we wanted to see and all of our emotions were the same when we saw the animals. When we saw the elephants we stuck are tongues out at them. When we saw the monkeys we started to laugh. When we saw the tigers we all made bug eyed looks at them and were scared. When we saw the giraffes we all wanted to ride them. We were all sad when we had to leave and when we got home dad asked us if we saw the tigers we all said yes and told him how scary they were.</p>
